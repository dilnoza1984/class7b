Create a method called calculate() that has 2 double parameters and displays the result of all arithemetic operators on those 2 values.
    

Example 1:

    calculate(10.0, 5.0) ->
      
      Addition: 15.0
      Multiplication: 50.0
      Division: 2.0
      Subtraction: 5.0
      Modulo: 0.0

Example 1:

    calculate(6.0, 4.0) ->
      
      Addition: 10.0
      Multiplication: 24.0
      Division: 1.5
      Subtraction: 2.0
      Modulo: 2.0
